                        Type merge configuration for this subschema. Let's say this subschema is a Users service schema
                             and provides the User type (with a query to fetch a user given the username)
                             ```gql
                             type Query {
                               GetUser(username: String): User
                             }
                             type User {
                               username: String
                               firstName: String
                               lastName: String
                             }
                             ```
                             and another subschema, e.g. Reviews schema, may have a partial User type:
                             ```gql
                             type Review {
                               author: User
                             }
                             type User {
                               username: String
                             }
                             ```
                             We want to provide the relevant information from this Users service schema,
                             so that another API that can give us a partial User type (with the username) will then
                             be able to have access to the full user type. With the correct type merging config under the Users subschema, e.g.:
                             ```yaml
                             type_merge:
                               User:
                                 selection_set: '{ username }'
                                 query_name: 'GetUser'
                                 args:
                                   username: username
                             ```
                             the stitched schema will now be able to provide the full user type to all types that require it. In this case,
                             we can now get the first name of an author from the Review.author field even though the Reviews schema doesn't
                             provide the full User type.

                                                variables defined in `variables` can be used in the jq filter via regular jq variable syntax.
                                                For example, a variable named "userIdHeader" can be used in a jq filter as `$userIdHeader`
                                                Jq filters must only result in one value, or an error will be sent back to the client.
                                                For example, for the input `[1,2,3]`, the jq filter '.[]' is not a valid jq filter as it results
                                                in multiple jq results. However, the jq filter '. &#124; join(",")' is valid as it results in one result: "1,2,3".

                                                variables defined in `variables` can be used in the jq filter via regular jq variable syntax.
                                                For example, a variable named "userIdHeader" can be used in a jq filter as `$userIdHeader`
                                                Jq filters must only result in one value, or an error will be sent back to the client.
                                                For example, for the input `[1,2,3]`, the jq filter '.[]' is not a valid jq filter as it results
                                                in multiple jq results. However, the jq filter '. &#124; join(",")' is valid as it results in one result: "1,2,3".
