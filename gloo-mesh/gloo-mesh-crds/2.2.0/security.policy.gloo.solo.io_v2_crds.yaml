              AccessPolicy is used to define how a destination service is granted. Specifically it describes
              both how clients should be authenticated and authorized to access the service.
              Refer to [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
              for further details about cross origin resource sharing.
              AccessPolicies are applied at the *Destination Port* level.

              ExtAuthPolicy is used to enforce external authorization/authentication of traffic matching selected routes or arriving at selected destinations.

              ExtAuthRoutePolicies can be applied at both the *Route* and *Destination* levels.

              JWTPolicy used to enable JWT Authentication for routes.

              Example:
              Sample JWT Payload:
              ```json
              {
                "org": "solo-io",
                "iss": "https://localhost",
                "exp": 4804324736,
                "iat": 1648651136
              }
              ```

              Configuration below will enable JWT Authentication for selected routes
              as well as inject a header into the request containing the value found
              within the parsed claim if it exists. Empty sources default to extracting
              JWTs from Authorization Header with prefix "Bearer <Token>"" or Query Param
              "access_token=<Token>"

              ```yaml
              apiVersion: security.policy.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: JWTPolicy
              metadata:
                name: <name>
                namespace: <namespace>
              spec:
                config:
                  providers:
                    <provider_name>:
                      issuer: "https://localhost"
                      local:
                        inline: |
                          <pem formatted public key>
                      claimsToHeaders:
                      - claim: org
                        header: x-org
                    stage: PRE_AUTHZ
              ```

              This example enables JWT Authentication for selected routes and
              request will be checked using token found at either X-Auth header with prefix
              "Bearer <token>" or query param "auth_token=<Token>". Note if a request has both
              sources available all tokens will need to be valid for the request to be accepted.

              ```yaml
              apiVersion: security.policy.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: JWTPolicy
