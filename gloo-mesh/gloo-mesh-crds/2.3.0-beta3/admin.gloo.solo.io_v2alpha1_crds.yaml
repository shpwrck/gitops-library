              Manages the deployment of Ambient L7 policy proxy (waypoint proxy) the selected Kubernetes service accounts.
              A RouteTable in ambient mode creates a server-side proxy to handle L7 routing, and to apply policies.
              Outlier detection and failover policies in an ambient mesh create a client-side L7 proxy.

                  The Kubernetes service account to that you want to apply the override settings to. Selects only the service accounts in the matching clusters.
                  If empty, the settings are applied to all service accounts in the workspace.
